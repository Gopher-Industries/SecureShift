# Week 9 Progress Summary - Shift Filtering & Attendance Improvements

## Overview
Completed implementation of shift visibility filtering based on guard availability and enhanced check-in/check-out functionality. Prepared for upcoming push notification integration work with team member Sanjolika.

## Key Contributions

• **Shift Visibility Filtering**: Implemented client-side filter layer that compares shift dates/times with guard availability windows, enabling guards to view only matching shifts or toggle between all shifts and availability-matched shifts.

• **Availability-Based Display**: Added empty-state messaging for scenarios where no shifts match guard availability, improving user experience and clarity.

• **Check-in/Check-out Improvements**: Enhanced attendance tracking functionality with improved validation, error handling, and user feedback mechanisms for more reliable shift attendance recording.

• **Next Week Planning**: Coordinated with Sanjolika to begin work on backend-triggered push notifications for shift reminders and document expiry alerts, including notification handling across all app states (foreground, background, closed) and deep linking to relevant screens.
